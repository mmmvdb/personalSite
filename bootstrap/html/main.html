        <p>This is an experiment in Bootstrap doubling as a personal profile.  This is a double whammy, two birds with one 
           stone, playground of sorts.  This is a way to tell you who I am, while at the same time I get to play with a new tool 
           I taught myself, Bootstrap 4!
        </p>
        
        <p>One of the many things I enjoy about life is learning about <strong>everything</strong>.  New discoveries in physics.
           Fresh recipes in the kitchen.  And of course new ways to tackle tough problems in software development.  There is 
           nothing that excites me more than encountering new things.  Unless it's meeting people with the same passions that I 
           do.
        </p>
        
        <p>So when it came time to sit down to introduce myself to the wide world I wanted to learn a new way to do it.  I read 
           through documentation most would find dry but I found new and exciting.  I spent time working with the new concepts 
           to hone them into actual knowledge.
        </p>
        
        <p>And finally I get to use that knowledge to craft a responsive webpage and show you my personality.
        </p>
        
        <a class="btn btn-primary btn-dark" data-toggle="collapse" href="#caveat1" aria-expanded="false" 
            aria-controls="multiCollapseExample1">Caveat</a>
        <div id="caveat" data-children=".caveatitem">
          <div class="caveatitem">
            <div id="caveat1" class="collapse" role="tabpanel">
              <p>There is a bit of a stigma around bootstrap that sites that use it all look the same.  This seems mainly due to 
                 the fact that people just copy and paste the first template they find on google, with no modifications or 
                 customizations.  I've tried to avoid that by not using a template and allowing myself to code the layout of the 
                 page myself.  I've only borrowed example components within the page from the documentation.
              </p>
              
              <p>I've heard it said that every want to be webdeveloper also codes up a page like this for their portfolios when in 
                 truth it is nothing special.  There may be truth to that, because it even at this early stage of my learning about 
                 it, it seems very easy to quickly get content up with no fuss.  A bit of pragmatism is good here, and knowing the 
                 tools available to you and what they are good for is important.  Bootstrap is good at getting responsive content up
                 with no complications and would be a good tool for prototyping or setting up layout on something that needed to be 
                 more involved or complex later.
              </p>
              
              <p>It has done it's task for me here, and on top of learning it has introduced me to some other things that I can now 
                 learn about, such as SCSS (Sass), LESS, and webdeveloper tools such as Koloa that can do some CSS compiling and 
                 autoprefixing of projects.  This just gives me more to learn so I consider this experiment a success.

              <h1 class="display-4 border border-left-0 border-right-0 border-top-0">My Work</h1>
                <p>I've spent the last 10 years working for a large software development corporation.  During my time there,
                participating in the whole software development life cycle.  I've contributed on complex existing projects,
                as well as starting one from the ground up.  On that project developing the front and back end of a project
                that I later helped maintain for six years.</p>

                <p>During this time communication has been key.  It was important to understand problems and discuss
                solutions between differing groups. I've lead conversations between these different grounds with their 
                and low level design specifications, code reviews, scrums, packaging and shipping and client validation.  
                And I suggested periodic improvements to the solution itself and to team processes in general. The whole
                spectrum of engineering at the corporation.</p>

                <p>I supported JIRA queues around the solution, working with many teams.  This effort included communications
                with clients and support teams and management. These concerned issue identification and correction,
                prioritization, and "work arounds" for clients.  Not to mention actual issue investigation and
                troubleshooting.</p>

                <p>Finally I collaborated with QAs to write efficient and accurate tests. Including helping with technical as
                well as process concerns to forge better testing. I also pioneered a testing minded frontend framework for
                the solution.</p>

                <p>Specifically, I created a web application that sat within the corporations main solution.  This solution 
                utilized HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery to handle the view layer of the solution.   I Worked with RESTful solutions to communicate between front end and back end. The backend was schema and scripts in a proprietary language based around Oracle PL/SQL. Schema creation and query performance expertise was necessary to bring the
                project to fruition. </p>

                <p>I also utilized Python to gather data from staging tables in client domains (running linux/unix OSes).
                Repackaging that data into XML submission files (per external specifications).</p>

                <p>I have experience with many software development tools/support languages. Such as: XML, JSON, SVN, GIT,
                GITHUB, Maven, Jenkins, Eclipse, REGex on top of the above languages brought up before.</p>
